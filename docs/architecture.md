# Atryum architecture

This document describes Atryum's internal boundaries, control flow, and durable state.
For installation, configuration examples, endpoint details, and operator workflows, see
the [README](../README.md).

## System context

Atryum is a Go service that mediates tool calls. It exposes runtime endpoints to agent
harnesses, an MCP-compatible proxy, and review/operator APIs used by its UI. All ingress
paths share the same invocation service, rule evaluation, and audit store.

The diagram corresponds to `internal/api`, `internal/managedagents`,
`internal/invocation`, `internal/store`, and `internal/mcp`.

## Runtime ingress

The entry path determines who executes an approved tool. It does not change how rules
or audit records are evaluated.

| Path | Service operation | Executor | Completion source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-tool hook: `POST /api/v1/external/invocations` | `Submit` | Calling harness | Harness reports through `PATCH /api/v1/external/invocations/{id}` |
| MCP proxy: `tools/call` on `/mcp/{server}` | `Invoke` | Atryum | Atryum records the upstream MCP result |
| Direct invocation: `POST /api/v1/invocations` | `Invoke` | Atryum | Atryum records the upstream MCP result |
| Managed Agents bridge | `Submit` and `RecordExecution` | Anthropic runtime | Watcher maps Anthropic events to invocation updates |

`Submit` intentionally leaves `upstream_name` empty because it makes a decision only.
`Invoke` resolves a configured MCP server before evaluating and executing the call.

## Component boundaries

| Package | Responsibility | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/api` | HTTP/MCP transport, authentication middleware, request/response mapping, embedded UI | Rule or invocation state transitions |
| `internal/invocation` | Invocation lifecycle, rule matching, AI evaluation dispatch, approval coordination | SQL or upstream transport details |
| `internal/store` | SQLite/PostgreSQL repositories, schema migrations, durable query semantics | Policy decisions |
| `internal/mcp` | Server resolution, MCP forwarding, upstream authentication and OAuth | Approval policy |
| `internal/auth` | Inbound OIDC/JWT validation and authenticated identity context | Upstream MCP credentials |
| `internal/managedagents` | Anthropic session discovery, event replay, confirmation delivery | Independent rule evaluation |

The React application in `ui/` is compiled into `internal/api/web/` for the production
binary. During development it can run separately, but it still uses the same review and
operator APIs.

## Decision pipeline

Rules are loaded in ascending `rule_order`. Matching uses server/source, tool, and the
resolved local agent record. A local agent record is derived from the authenticated
runtime identity; on the no-auth external path, the submitted `agent_id` is used.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Invocation created with status received]
    Match[Find enabled matching rules in rule_order]
    Any{At least one rule matches?}
    Evaluate[Evaluate next matching rule]
    Action{Rule result}
    More{Another matching rule?}
    Policy[Evaluate configured default policy]
    Approve[Auto approve]
    Deny[Auto deny]
    Human[Enter pending_approval]

    Start --> Match --> Any
    Any -->|no| Policy
    Any -->|yes| Evaluate --> Action
    Action -->|approved| Approve
    Action -->|denied| Deny
    Action -->|human approval| Human
    Action -->|next_rule| More
    More -->|yes| Evaluate
    More -->|no| Human
    Policy -->|auto| Approve
    Policy -->|never| Deny
    Policy -->|human or error| Human
```

`next_rule` is produced only by `ai_evaluation`. If every matching AI rule defers,
Atryum falls back to human approval. The global policy provider is used only when no
rule matches; it is not evaluated after a matching rule defers.

An `ai_evaluation` rule selects one configured evaluator. Standalone deployments use
a local LLM configuration stored in `llm_configs`. Evaluation errors escalate to human
review; missing charter context denies; and an unknown verdict is treated as
`next_rule`, eventually reaching human review if no later rule decides.

## Atryum-executed calls

`Invoke` owns the complete execution lifecycle. A human-gated HTTP request stays
open until its invocation row leaves
`pending_approval` or the caller's request context is cancelled (a client
disconnect or a client-side timeout). Atryum imposes no approval deadline of its
own: the configured `request_timeout_seconds` bounds upstream tool execution, not
the human wait.

Because the row is the source of truth, an approval or denial recorded by any
process releases the held request. With PostgreSQL, the transaction that
records the decision sends `NOTIFY atryum_invocation_decided` with the
invocation ID, and each process keeps one connection on `LISTEN` to wake its
held request at once; the request also re-reads its row every two seconds as
the fallback. SQLite has no notifications, so there it re-reads every 250 ms. Decisions and the move to `executing` are
compare-and-set on the row's status, so a call is decided once and run once.
What is not implemented:

- Caller cancellation marks a still-pending (or approved but not yet running)
  invocation failed. The stored error text says "cancelled", but the persisted
  status is `failed`.
- An abrupt process exit drops the held request. Nothing resumes it on another
  process, so a later approval updates the row but does not execute the tool.

        end
        Service-->>Caller: Result or denial
    end
```

The admin invocation stream is a polling SSE view: the handler queries the durable
invocation list every two seconds and emits when its signature changes. Database writes
do not directly publish to the stream.

## Decision-only calls

`Submit` persists and returns a decision without contacting an MCP server. An external
executor polls a pending invocation, runs the tool only after approval, and reports its
execution state.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> received: Submit
    received --> approved: automatic approval
    received --> denied: automatic denial
    received --> pending_approval: human decision required
    pending_approval --> approved: admin approves
    pending_approval --> denied: admin denies
    approved --> executing: PATCH running
    executing --> executing: PATCH running
    approved --> succeeded: PATCH completed
    approved --> failed: PATCH failed
    approved --> cancelled: PATCH cancelled
    executing --> succeeded: PATCH completed
    executing --> failed: PATCH failed
    executing --> cancelled: PATCH cancelled
```

The state diagram shows the supported caller contract, not enforced transitions.
`RecordExecution` currently validates only the transition to `running`; the terminal
reports (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) are applied without checking the prior
status, so callers must not report a terminal outcome before approval. When inbound auth supplies an agent identity, the service also checks that
the invocation belongs to that agent. In no-auth mode, ownership cannot be verified.

## Managed Agents bridge

Each configured account can run watchers for linked Anthropic sessions. A watcher
replays events from its persisted cursor, follows the live SSE stream, and reconnects
after failures. Tool calls still use `Submit`, so this bridge does not introduce a
second policy engine.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Watcher
    participant Anthropic as Managed Agents API
    participant Service as invocation.Service
    participant Store

    Watcher->>Anthropic: List events after persisted cursor
    Anthropic-->>Watcher: Backlog
    Watcher->>Anthropic: Open live event stream
    Anthropic-->>Watcher: tool_use
    Watcher->>Store: Append raw session audit event
    Watcher->>Service: Submit external invocation
    Service->>Store: Persist decision
    Anthropic-->>Watcher: status_idle with requires_action
    loop until decided
        Watcher->>Service: Get invocation
        Service-->>Watcher: Current status
    end
    Watcher->>Anthropic: Send allow or deny event
    opt allowed
        Watcher->>Service: RecordExecution running
        Anthropic-->>Watcher: tool_result
        Watcher->>Service: RecordExecution completed or failed
    end
    Note over Watcher,Store: Each successfully handled event advances the persisted cursor
```

Tool-use submission is idempotent across replay because the Anthropic event ID is used
as the invocation idempotency key. Cursor advancement waits until the event handler has
completed successfully enough to avoid skipping a confirmation that must be retried.

## Durable model

The core tables are:

| Table | Architectural role |
|---|---|
| `invocations` | Current state and request/result material for each governed call |
| `invocation_events` | Ordered event history for an invocation, written with each state change |
| `approval_rules` | Ordered match criteria and decision action |
| `agents` | Mapping from runtime identities to named governance records |
| `mcp_servers` | Runtime upstream definitions and connection state |
| `oauth_credentials` and `oauth_connect_sessions` | Upstream OAuth credentials and browser-flow state |
| `llm_configs` | Local AI-evaluation providers |
| `managed_agent_bindings`, `managed_agent_sessions` | Anthropic agent/session ownership and replay state |
| `external_sessions` | Atryum-minted harness sessions linking external invocations for cross-call evaluation context |

Schema changes are ordered migrations under `internal/store/migrations/` and are
applied at startup for both SQLite and PostgreSQL.

An invocation's row is the authoritative record of current state. Every change
to it is written in one transaction with its `invocation_events` row, so state
and history cannot disagree; an embedding program's event hook
(`pkg/atryum.WithEventHook`) runs inside that same transaction.

## Embedding

`pkg/atryum` runs this server as a library. Besides extra routes, migrations and
the database handle, an embedding program can set:

- `WithDecider`: every call on every path is decided by the program (allow,
  notify, deny, or pending with a review ID). Rules, plans and the default policy
  are skipped, a decider error denies, and only agent-facing routes are mounted.
- `WithEventHook`: called with the transaction for every invocation change, so
  the program's own records commit or roll back with it. A change that cannot
  be recorded before a tool runs stops the call (it is denied); once the tool
  has run, its outcome is recorded even if the caller has gone, and a failure
  to record it is logged rather than returned, so the agent is not invited to
  retry a call that already ran.
- `WithRequireAgentAuth`: refuse to start without an enabled `[[auth]]` issuer
  or with `skip_verify`, and reject agent requests without a verified identity.
- `WithDatabaseURL`: the database URL, overriding the config file.

## Configuration and ownership

`atryum.toml` owns process bootstrap concerns: listening, database selection, inbound
auth, optional external service credentials, default policy, and initial upstreams.
After the first successful bootstrap, MCP server definitions, rules, agents, evaluator
settings, and connection state are database-owned and managed through the operator APIs.

This separation prevents runtime changes from being overwritten by a restart. In
particular, `[[upstreams]]` seeds an empty `mcp_servers` table; it is not continuous
configuration reconciliation.

## Authentication boundaries

Inbound and upstream authentication are separate trust boundaries:

- Agent runtime auth validates bearer tokens and places the configured agent identity
  claim in request context. The invocation service uses that trusted identity for rule
  targeting and ownership checks.
- Privileged API auth protects operator APIs when an auth provider has
  `admin_enabled = true` and the configured admin claim is present.
- Upstream MCP authentication is owned by `internal/mcp/auth_provider`; credentials and
  OAuth tokens are never returned to the agent caller.
- No-auth mode is a local deployment option. Identity supplied by a caller in this mode
  is attribution, not a cryptographic ownership guarantee.
